# 🧠 Deep Learning Experiments

This folder focuses on artificial neural networks and advanced deep learning concepts.

Examples include:
- Fully connected neural networks (ANN)  
- Convolutional neural networks (CNN) for images  
- Recurrent neural networks (RNN) and LSTMs for sequences  
- Experimentation with Keras and TensorFlow frameworks  

The goal is to understand how deep models learn complex patterns in data.
